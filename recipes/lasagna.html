    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p> This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it. Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.</p>

    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
